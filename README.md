# TenantMetrics

Two functions that constitute a process that pulls data every minute from the subdirectories ./var/run/tenant/ directory tree and placing the sorted data from the json files within into a csv file. All that is necessary is to run Run.py, and it will handle the rest provided that it is in the correct directory location.
